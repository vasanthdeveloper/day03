3. Difference between window,screen and document in javascript
ANSWER:-In JavaScript, document, screen, and window are all built-in objects that are used to interact with the web page and the browser.
However, they represent different aspects of the web page and the browser.
DOCUMENT:
         The document object represents the HTML document that is currently loaded in the web page. 
It provides access to the HTML elements in the document and allows you to manipulate them dynamically using JavaScript. 
For example, you can use the document.getElementById() method to retrieve an element by its ID and modify its content.
SCREEN:
       The screen object represents the physical screen of the device that is displaying the web page. 
It provides information about the screen size, resolution, and color depth. 
You can use the screen.width and screen.height properties to retrieve the dimensions of the screen.
WINDOW:
       The window object represents the browser window that contains the web page. 
It provides access to the methods and properties of the browser window, such as window.open() and window.close(). 
It also provides information about the browser, such as the URL of the current page (window.location.href) and the browser's history (window.history).

In summary, document is used to manipulate the content of the HTML document, 
screen is used to retrieve information about the physical screen, 
and window is used to interact with the browser window and retrieve information about the browser.
